#identifiers
# An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
#Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _. Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
# An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.
